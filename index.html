        <h1>Happy</h1>
        <h2>"Happy" is a song written, produced, and performed by American musician Pharrell Williams, released as the only single from the soundtrack album for the 2013 film Despicable Me 2.
            I enjoy this song because it is upbeat and inspiring, I find myself in a good mood whenever I hear it come on.

            <h2>Fun Trivia!</h2>
        <h3>Pharrell wrote and produced “Happy” for the soundtrack of Despicable Me 2—it also became the lead single of his second studio album, G I R L.<br>
            The song appears in a scene in the film where the lead character Gru dances through streets with joy because he has fallen in love.<br>
            “Happy” is repeated 56 times over the course of the song. 62% of the “Happy” is dedicated to its catchy chorus—about 20% more than the average pop song.<br>
            The first-ever 24-hour music video was made for “Happy”—it follows 400 different people enjoying life while they walk around LA.</h3>
